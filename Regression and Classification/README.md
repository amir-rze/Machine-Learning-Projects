Ridge Regression : As you know from the mathematical relationships available in the slides, calculate the final weights using Ridge Regression. This calculation is feasible. At the end of the process, using the mathematical relationship available for Ridge Regression, calculate the coefficients of the polynomial and compare the values obtained with the original values. Firstly, test the case without a penalty, meaning the alpha value equal to zero (linear regression), and then analyze and compare the output values, overfitting, etc., by testing three different values of alpha (small to large) and analyze and compare when alpha is larger than a certain limit. Like part b, use the Lasso model from the sklearn library for the problem, testing with different values of alpha, and analyze and compare the results without needing to use the mathematical relationship.


Classification SVM : Using the descriptions available in this link, start by generating datasets with varying numbers of data points, ranging from 50 to 500, for the circle and moon shapes. Continue by employing the SVM model with different kernels (linear, RBF, poly, and sigmoid) and at least two different values for the C parameter. Perform classification on each of the four (at least) data sets 8 times using different combinations of kernels and C values. For this question, examine the effect of kernel types on the SVM and the impact of the C parameter.


Text Classifiction: Refer to the Text Classificaiton notebook for this question, where you are tasked with designing a classifier suitable for textual data presented in the notebook, with the objective of categorizing a given sentence into one of several categories such as political, sports, or business. After preprocessing the provided text data series, complete the cells requested by you to solve the classification problem and attempt testing with various models within a pipeline.
