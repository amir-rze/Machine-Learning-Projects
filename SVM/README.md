Problem explanation: In this exercise, we want to perform a classification task using Support Vector Machine (SVM). For this purpose, we use the Mnist dataset, which is a collection of handwritten digit images along with their labels. Initially, we load this dataset offline (with the data file available locally) and prepare it for SVM training with some preprocessing. In this exercise, you are asked to use SVM with two kernels, RBF and Linear, and evaluate the results by calculating F1 measure, Recall, Precision values and displaying the confusion matrix. Finally, adjust the hyperparameters using Grid Search
